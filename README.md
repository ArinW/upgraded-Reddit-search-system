**Project Title:** Intelligent Reddit Recommendation System using IR and Web Agent Techniques

---

**1. Importance and Motivation**

Reddit is a rich platform of user-generated content spanning thousands of communities. Yet, its native recommendation system is limited. This project addresses the problem of:

- Discovering new but relevant content.
- Surfacing quality posts outside a user's immediate subscriptions.
- Leveraging semantic content understanding for personalized recommendations.

It combines Information Retrieval (IR) and Web Agent techniques to enhance Reddit exploration.

---

**2. Usefulness / Applications**

- Recommend relevant Reddit posts based on a user query or upvote history.
- Suggest subreddits or threads for new users based on reading patterns.
- Use real-time or periodic scraping to ensure fresh content.
- Serve as a portfolio project to demonstrate skills in NLP, search systems, and recommendation engines.

**3. Step-by-Step Development Plan**

**Step 1: Define Scope**
- Choose recommendation target: post, subreddit, or comment.
- Decide if the system will be query-based or history-based.

**Step 2: Data Collection**
- Use Reddit API or Pushshift to collect:
  - Post metadata (title, body, subreddit, timestamp, upvotes)
  - User behavior (if building a personalized engine)
  - Comments (for deeper semantic features)

**Step 3: Web Agent Design**
- Implement a crawler or API wrapper that:
  - Handles pagination and rate-limiting
  - Stores content in a structured format (JSON, SQLite)

**Step 4: Text Preprocessing**
- Clean text (lowercase, remove stopwords)
- Tokenize and optionally stem/lemmatize
- Extract features like named entities or key phrases

**Step 5: Indexing with IR**
- Choose between:
  - TF-IDF vectors with cosine similarity
  - Sentence-BERT or OpenAI Embeddings + FAISS
  - Elasticsearch for hybrid ranking

**Step 6: Recommendation Engine**
- Build logic for:
  - Query-to-post matching (like semantic search)
  - Post-to-post similarity (for "you might also like")
  - History-based post or subreddit suggestions

**Step 7: Ranking & Filtering**
- Apply scoring rules using IR similarity, time decay, and popularity.
- Consider diversity metrics to avoid echo chambers.

**Step 8: Interface / Demo App**
- Use Streamlit, Flask, or FastAPI
- Components:
  - Search bar or user profile input
  - Ranked list of recommended posts
  - Filters for subreddit, time, or score

**Step 9: Evaluation**
- Use precision@k, recall@k if ground truth available
- Manual evaluation for relevance
- User feedback loop (if deployed)

---

**4. Bonus Extensions**
- Summarize posts with GPT or a summarization model.
- Include comment sentiment in ranking.
- User clustering or community detection for group recommendations.
- Logging user interactions for online learning.

---

**5. Resume Value**
- Demonstrates end-to-end IR + NLP + scraping + backend integration.
- Useful for roles in ML engineering, data science, search, and AI product design.
- Highly modular: extensible into product-grade or research projects.
