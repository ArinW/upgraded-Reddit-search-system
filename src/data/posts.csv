1ka0b6g,"Is it possible I’m being blacklisted? Strange patterns in job search (F, Architectural Designer)","I’m a female Architectural Designer with 7 years of experience. I’ve been laid off twice in the past 5 years, and lately my job search has felt... off.

Six months ago, I applied to a top local firm. The recruiter (M) responded the same day to schedule an interview, but an hour after I confirmed, I got a rejection saying the position was filled. Last week, the same recruiter messaged me on LinkedIn asking if I was interested. We scheduled a call—then he canceled last minute with no explanation and never followed up.

Similar things have happened with other firms—being close to offers, then sudden rejections, even when they’re still hiring. I also got strange vibes reapplying to my first firm.

The only thing I can think of is a dispute years ago with a senior architect (M) at my first job who didn’t like that I was outshining him. Some former colleagues now work at these firms.

Am I overthinking this, or could something from my past be affecting my chances? Has anyone experienced something similar? How do you handle potential reputation issues in a small industry?

1ka07mm,What advice would you give someone changing careers completely at 46?,"Hi all,

I’m a 46-year-young guy (still feel 30 most days!), and I have a job I like, but the wages aren’t amazing. There’s some room to grow in the company over time, but honestly, not a lot.

I’ve been working in retail for the past 10 years (just switched to a new company about a year ago). Lately, I keep thinking about making a bigger move — something I’ve always been interested in is cloud computing. I’ve even started working on AWS certifications.

At the same time, there’s that voice in my head saying maybe it’s a bit crazy to switch industries completely at my age. Cloud/tech feels full of younger, sharper people, and there’s a lot of competition too.
But realistically, it feels like this could be my last real chance to make a complete career change — to build something better for myself for the next 10–15+ years.

So yeah — I’m ready for a change, but those doubts still creep in sometimes.
If you’ve changed careers later in life, or have any advice for someone starting fresh at 46, I’d love to hear it!

Thanks a lot!

1ka04wv,Should I move on?,"Hi, TIA for feedback. Here's my situation: 

I'm in Chicago. Interviewed for a digital comms role at a nonprofit org. After my first interview (virtual with HR director), I didn't hear back from them (despite following up) for over a month. Then, I did a virtual interview with director of comms. Right after that interview, they asked me to come in for an in person interview. 

At the in person interview, I met with director of comms again and some other program directors. Here's the interesting part: they gave me a folder with a very detailed list of their health insurance plans, so I figured my chance of getting the job was very high, if not set in stone. 

It's been 18 days since that interview and I did a follow up email the Monday after the interview (which was on a Thursday), thanking everyone for their time etc. On the 21st, I sent a follow up email about the status of my interviews. radio silence. It's been 18 days since my third interview. 

Do you think this is a sign I should move on to other job applications? Does this mean I likely didn't get the job? I'm thrown off by their inconsistent communication, but this is my dream job and they did give me the health insurance info after all...

I feel like I’ve built a solid portfolio for someone starting out, but I've been looking for an SEO job for a while now without success. So far, I haven’t even been able to land a single interview.  
  
This makes me wonder: is it possible that my resume isn’t communicating my experience properly? Or maybe it's my LinkedIn profile or the way I’m applying?

1k9z4h3,America’s secret weapon but also uncomfortable truth: our economy is the best due to immigration from other countries (yes h1Bs). It’s not just because they bring cheaper labor. They create some of the largest companies in the world.,"In 2024, 46% of Fortune 500 companies-230 out of 500-were founded by immigrants or their children, generating over $8.6 trillion in revenue and employing more than 15.5 million people.

Nvidia : founded by Jensen Huang, Taiwanese immigrant 

Google: cofounded by Sergey Brin, Russian immigrant 

Space X : Elon Musk, South African immigrant 

Uber: Garrett Camp, Canadian immigrant 

AMD ceo who turned the company around: Lisa Su, Taiwanese immigrant

DoorDash: founded by Tony Xu, Chinese immigrant  

kohls : founded by Maxwell Kohls, Polish immigrant.

The list goes on and on. If you include children of immigrants it gets even longer as Bezos and Jobs were sons of immigrants.


This is a double edged sword for America. Our economy is driven by getting the best immigrants in the world which has separated America from everyone else. Unfortunately, this causes a natural tension between local/ native born citizens and h1B immigrants for employment.

1k9yj9g,I finally got an offer for my dream job but just got told my urine was too diluted on the drug test.,"I have not done any drugs in over a year (and by drugs I mean marijuana). My pee is clean. I went to take a drug test for my new job and the hours the drug testing facility had posted online were different than when I got there. When I got there, there was a sign on the door with different hours. They were closed part of the afternoon. So I drove back home to wait. Except when I got home, I really had to pee. Then I realized I wouldn’t be able to pee by the time I went back to do my drug test in an hour. So I drank a bunch of water. It didn’t even occur to me that this would dilute the test. I’m someone who chugs water all day as it is. I carry a water bottle with me everywhere. So I’m probably over hydrated anyway. 

I went back to do my drug test and my urine was light yellow but it wasn’t clear for anything so I thought I was fine. 

I just got a call from HR where a woman informed me, in a very condescending and somewhat accusatory manner, that my drug test was diluted and that she had already informed my future boss. She acted like I had done something sneaky and I felt so upset I could cry. They’re giving me a chance to get a second test done but if this one comes back as diluted too then it’s an automatic fail. 

I’m so nervous and paranoid now. Im planning to retake the test tomorrow morning and just not drinking any water. (However I’m worried I won’t be able to pee?) I’m also worried that this is really starting me off on a bad foot with my new boss. I’m embarrassed and worried they will think I was trying to hide something. I have an anxiety disorder and this is really messing with me. 

Can anyone in HR tell me how common this is? If you were an employer would you find this suspicious? Would it change your opinion of an employee?

1k9xolv,Need advice on whether I should quit my job,"I’ll try to keep it short and simple with a list of pros and cons of working at my current job. I work as administrative assistant for a small company. For some more context, I am 24 years old so still very early in my career, and my degree is in graphic design (minor in business administration).

**Pros of Working Here:**

•Decent pay, seems better than other admin assistant roles. Also get PTO, but not many other benefits.

•Independent role. I don’t really have many coworkers so I work by myself mostly all day. This is great for popping in my airpods and being able to listen to music or podcasts while I work.

•Gained some valuable office skills here, as this was my first office role. Also less anxious about answering phones now.

**Cons of Working Here:**

•Family business, so lots of nepotism. My only other coworker (let’s call her Ellie) is family so she gets lots of privileges. Work from home, shorter hours, better pay. Can take off whenever. 

•With Ellie barely coming into the office, I am basically the office slave. I am expected to do everything under the sun. Ellie is also much more experienced than I am, and she will put new systems into place, then will barely train me on them (since she barely works), and then will expect me to take it over and become a master with minimal training or understanding. Then is barely available when I have questions on said program.

•Deal with a narcissistic/stubborn boss, who also is a boomer and is really bad with technology. Always asking me for help with tech issues (which i’m no expert in), and is an extreme micromanager. Lashes out when stressed. Also extremely nosy and always needs to know the exact reasons for when I use PTO.

•Following up on the micromanagement, my boss has cameras in the office that he watches religiously. I feel like I’m on the Truman show every day. I see him watching my desk through his phone and I hear feedback when I’m on the phones. He’s always watching and listening (which I didn’t know when I agreed to the job offer). Even has access to building/parking lot cameras and watches those as well.

•No interest in my work, as this is not the field I studied and I barely have motivation to get work done. 

•Having an independent role is nice, but as a young person starting in my career, I would prefer to have more coworkers and people I can actually collab with.


Clearly, the cons of working here outweigh the pros.. so, why do I stay? I have job security here in this terrible, shitty job market.. and my field is extremely competitive. I do not know if I will even be able to find another job, I’m operating from a place of scarcity. I also fear having a resume gap, and employers would usually rather hire someone who is employed than unemployed. My parents are also very pro-capitalism and would look down on me for leaving my job even if I don’t have something else lined up. The goal is to have another job to jump to, but I think i’m still going to quit in a few months if I can’t find something better. I’m just slowly losing it here. 

On the bright side, I have almost $20k saved up, I live at home so no rent/groceries bills, and my boyfriend just got a new job so he could support me in some areas.

So.. should I just leave? What’s the right decision here? Next month marks my one year, and I want to get out before I get even more wrapped up in this position. I feel like the expiration date here has long since passed and i’m just wasting my time moving forward. There’s no long-term career growth here.

1k9xiok,Over 55 and Struggling to Find Work in Tech... Is it Time to Move On... I want to Hear Your Thoughts..!,"Seriously, I REALLY need your help and guidance. The mental stress is becoming more and more difficult as the days go on. 

So here is my story... I'm 57 years old, and I'm going to be 58 in June. I've been in the Tech Industry for over 35 years. I've been in a senior management role for the last 14 years or so at various levels of Infrastructure Engineering and Datacenter Operations.  Due to budget cuts, I was laidoff off back in February of 2024 after being with the company for 10 years, so its been over a year now.  It was my first layoff ever and to be perfectly honest with you, I'm extremely embarrassed by the whole situation. My plan was to retire at the company, now here I am at this stage of my life, starting over... updating my Resume, reaching out to the recruiters, etc...

Like I mentioned, I've been in the corporate world working for many Fortune 500 companies for over 35 years now. I thought that was a great accomplishment that I am very proud of... as it turns out, some of my recruiter friends are telling me to reduce my years of experience down from 35 years to 10 or 15... and limit my resume to 2 pages with the work experience going back no more than 12 years.  They also suggested tailoring my resume to each specific job posting. They informed me that, there is a lot of Ageism for those that are 45 and older... 45 and OLDER.. are you kidding me.  Admittedly, part of my struggles that I've been facing is, that I've been in the management role for the last 12 years or so, and hands-off technology.  Granted I have my MCSE, CCNA and other industry IT certifications, but they have all expired for many years now.  The way the tech industry is ATM, I just dont have it in me to go back to hands-on, and get the certifications again.  But by the same token, I think I have a lot more to offer than stocking shelves at Lowes.  Hell, I've even applied for a lesser position with a reduced salary in Tech, and I'm still being questioned about it...""are you sure this is something you see yourself doing long term""... by that they mean, until you find another job

To be honest, I want to work and be a part of something. I dont want to, nor am I ready to retire at 57. But at some point, I have a draw a line in the sand and move on and make a decision. 

So I want to hear your stories and thoughts... are you struggling at a later stage of your life trying to find a new job....? are you in Tech (if so, what area) did you stay in tech or get out...I want to hear what you guys/gals have to say...

Thanks..

1k9xahp,"Here’s why I, a 27 year old black man, left my $400,000/year fully remote job to become an influencer","# First some self-congratulatory bullshit

Because the title of this article has an extraordinary claim, allow me to first provide some extraordinary evidence.

In January 2022, I joined Oscar Health as a full-time software engineer. This was when the job market was pretty good, and because of my skill as an engineer and the “name brand” of having an MS in Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon, I was able to negotiate a much higher than average total compensation.

What does “higher than average” actually mean? Let’s break it down.

[Pic: Offer letter from Oscar Health](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*RgCRXGXRJS3vJE7ZvYYLYQ.png)

The offer letter details:

* The starting salary for the position **($145,000/year)**
* The performance bonus of 10% **($14,500/year)**
* The restricted stock units **or RSUs ($45,000/year)**
* A sign-on bonus **($10,000)**

I’m no mathematician, but I’m pretty sure that adds up to **$214,500**. Not bad for a 24 year old.

But it got even better.

Due to exceptional performance, I was promoted to Software Engineer II within one year at the company.

[Pic: My promotion letter from Oscar Health](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*vpyfiLDBPsbUe8VpUdIqXw.png)

This promotion came with a significant increase in compensation. My base salary increased to **$159,500** and my annual bonus increased to **$23,925**. I also got a refresher of **$67,500 (across 3 years)**.

Literal surgeon salary.

The following year was uneventful. My base salary increased to **$165,800**. I received yet another refresher (like every other engineer at the company) and my bonus naturally increased because it’s weighted at 15% of my salary.

So in total:

* I had 6,347 shares of OSCR (initially) + 4,937 shares (after the first refresher) and 1,599 shares (after the second refresher). All together, that equaled **12,883 shares/year**
* At a peak price of **$22.93/share**, that equaled to **$295,484/year** of equity
* My salary was **$165,800 and I had a 15% annual bonus ($24,870/year)**

With all of this, my compensation peaked at an unbelievable **$486,154/year.**

But that’s the peak price, which is misleading. If we take the average price of Oscar Health in 2024 ($16.57), that’s still **$404,293/year**.

[Pic: Asking the NexusTrade AI for the average price of Oscar Health](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*ESB7Z8fFRBSv1ZhAZlW7gg.png)

And I gave ALL of that away…. to make videos of me lip syncing on TikTok.

# Why would I leave tech to be an influencer?

Don’t get me wrong — at heart I’m still a tech guy — a software engineer. I’m just one with an insane plan….

To build my own marketing channel and unlock an infinite money glitch.

You see, for the past half a decade, I’ve been obsessively working on something that would convince even Tony Stark and Elon Musk that I’m the bigger visionary — a new type of investing platform.

But before I talk about the platform, let me explain the “influencer” jab I made at the beginning.

**An unusual approach to marketing**

As a tech guy who built a B2C SaaS company, I struggled with marketing for a while. At first, I just wrote Medium articles and saw a fair amount of success, achieving over 275K views on my articles at my peak in January, and over 145K views in the past month.

[Pic: My Medium views in January 2025](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*ZaJ_Pdtu-U75FYzRy7zLuw.png)

But this wasn’t enough. I wanted more.

I explored my options. I shit-post on Reddit, which works a little bit, but doesn’t give me that “viral” effect that I believe my app deserves. I’ve also tried doing some UGC marketing, but that was expensive and didn’t really achieve the results I wanted.

I ended up realizing that if I wanted to grow my app at the speed I wanted, I would have to do one of three things:

1. Spend a metric fuckton of money on advertisements
2. Spend a metric fuckton of money on bigger influencers for the privilege of an 8 second story post
3. Become an influencer

I’m a smart guy. I went to Cornell and Carnegie Mellon. I’ve built an app that nobody thought was possible.

Thus, if I can literally achieve the impossible, how hard can it *really* be to become an influencer?

So that’s what I’m doing now. While I’m technically a founder or an entrepreneur or a software engineer, I now fully identify as an influencer.

And what exactly will I be “influencing”? I will be fixing the broken retail trading system.

**The Problem of Retail Investing**

Right now, almost every single retail investor is a degenerate gambler. They don’t even hide it.

* They maybe know the phrase “DYOR” but don’t know how to *actually* do their own research in practice
* They might build trading plans, but they always crumble in the face of fear and uncertainty
* And, they’re obsessed with getting rich quick, but don’t even know how to build a sensible (high-risk) plan. Instead, they gamble based on 0 DTE SPY calls

Above all, retail investors just truly don’t understand what it means to build a trading strategy.

So I built a web app to fix this.

# An AI Approach to the stock market

I built [NexusTrade](https://nexustrade.io), an AI-Powered trading platform that lets retail investors create, test, optimize, and deploy algorithmic trading strategies.

[Link: NexusTrade - No-Code Automated Trading and Research](https://nexustrade.io/)

It’s basically a website that solves the retail trading problem with the help of AI.

And I know that if you’re in tech, you visibly cringed when I said the letters “A” and “I”. You’re sick of this by now. But unlike Silicon Valley’s darling companies, this app *actually* solves real problems.

This is demonstrated by the reviews of people that have used it.

**The institutional investors that have used NexusTrade**

For example, take the opinion of Jeffery Fan.

[Pic: A Google Calendar Invite between me and Jeffery](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*MyvmNvauusnMYQjdu93v5A@2x.jpeg)

I had an exciting opportunity to talk with Jeff and give him a personalized demo of the platform. Jeffrey works at Scotiabank, the third largest bank in Canada.

And when I say “works there”, he’s not like a janitor or a lowly intern. He has over 3 decades of experience and is the **Managing Director & Global Head of Equity Research**.

I showed him all of NexusTrade’s features, tips, and tricks, and he was beyond impressed. He outright could not believe that a single person was capable of building something so extraordinary. If the Google Meet transcript was recorded, I’d be blasting that everywhere too.

As if one institutional investor isn’t enough, I actually have another.

Take Spencer Kalish.

[Pic: A review of NexusTrade from Spencer K](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*kCS7OBCOOjtO1kAvzf0s_w@2x.jpeg)

Spencer works as the **Global Chief of Staff at UBS**, one of the world‘s largest financial institutions.

Spencer didn’t just think [NexusTrade](https://nexustrade.io/) was cool, he was genuinely shocked at the comprehensiveness of the platform.

Because of his reaction, I mustered up the courage to ask him to let me write a review of the platform to increase my credibility. Everyone claims to have the best trading platform in the world, but how many people have real institutional investors backing up those words?

He happily obliged.

But that’s not all. He also set me up with another meeting to have yet another demo… This time with Jamshed Cooper, the Managing Director of the Non-Core and Legacy Technology Division at UBS.

[Pic: A meeting with me, Spender, and the managing director at UBS on May 8th](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*FDRi5Dso6c08JFIucl-8wA@2x.jpeg)

During that meeting, we’re going to have a technical chat about how NexusTrade works under the hood. Something I’m super excited to nerd out about.

And, **while the opinions of these individuals do NOT represent an official position from the banks** (but rather personal opinions from the individuals within their institutions), the fact that these people genuinely think that the platform I spent so long building was genuinely cool makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

But it’s not just the big banks that have a positive opinion of Nexus.

More than 20,000 other folks do too.

**Not just for institutions**

In addition to the opinion of these institutional investors, [NexusTrade](https://nexustrade.io/) is enjoyed by over 23,500 users.

[Pic: A graph showing NexusTrade growth over time](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*C_wepAttpFjZ48RCsqU_YQ.png)

Users of all backgrounds and experience levels are enjoying it, from ordinary middle school teachers to senior lecturers at Harvard Business School.

**What about NexusTrade makes it so useful for retail investors?**

The reason why people of all experience levels enjoy the platform is that it is literally built to be a Wall Street-grade platform with the ease of use and simplicity of Robinhood.

Algorithmic trading is inherently difficult, so it’s still not meant for everybody. Nonetheless, for the savvy investor, this platform LITERALLY teaches you how to become a systematic algorithmic trader. For example:

* [Trading tutorials give you step-by-step instructions on how to create trading strategies and perform financial research](https://nexustrade.io/tutorials)
* [Deep Dives teach you how to analyze a stock comprehensively](https://nexustrade.io/deep-dive)
* [The shared portfolios page allows you to copy, modify, and learn from existing public live-trading portfolios](https://nexustrade.io/shared-portfolio)

If you want to have a deep dive into NexusTrade’s AI features, [**check out the rest of the articles on my Medium**](https://medium.com/@austin-starks)! For example, [**this article below**](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/i-evaluated-grok-3-as-the-best-ai-model-for-traders-and-investors-c539d6251a83) does a great job at describing how NexusTrade can be done to perform financial research and deploy algorithmic trading strategies.

# Concluding Thoughts

Leaving behind a $400,000 salary was undoubtedly the biggest financial risk I’ve ever taken, but I believe the potential reward of building NexusTrade into a revolutionary platform for retail investors justifies this leap of faith.

The positive feedback from institutional investors and our growing user base of over 23,500 people confirms that I’m addressing a genuine need in the market.

Becoming an influencer might seem like an unusual path for someone with my technical background, but it’s simply the most effective way to reach the people who need this platform most. The journey from software engineer to founder to content creator has taught me that sometimes the most unconventional routes lead to the greatest innovations.

1k9x7za,Struggling to Find a Full-Time HR/I-O Role After Graduation — Looking for Advice,"Hi everyone,

I'm hoping it's okay to ask for some guidance here. I’ve been working hard to transition into the I/O Psychology/Human Resources fields for over a year now, but it’s been a tough journey. I have a BA in Psychology and recently earned my MA in Industrial/Organizational Psychology from the University of Hartford, graduating with a 4.0 GPA.

While studying (and after finishing), I was fortunate to land a few contract roles in HR and I/O work. However, finding a full-time, long-term position has been a real challenge. I'm open to any HR-related opportunities and have been applying broadly, but I haven't had much luck so far. I genuinely want to grow with a company, contribute to their workforce development, and see the long-term impact of the work I do.

Despite getting to final interview rounds a few times, I often either don't hear back or receive automated rejections. I've also tried connecting with recruiting agencies, but that hasn’t led to many opportunities yet.

I would be happy to share my resume if that's helpful. If anyone has advice, feedback, or even just some encouragement, I would truly appreciate it. Lately, it's been hard to stay positive, but I'm trying to keep pushing forward. Please if anyone has any advice or leads at all or would be willing to message/connect it would be so helpful to me.

1k9x0w7,I feel stuck,"Hi,

Last fall, I left my minimum wage job in a supermarket for an office job. I was happy to see something moving in my career, even if it's totally unrelated to my field and study and doesn't do that much to increase my worth on my resume.

Whatever, I was happy for a little salary increase.

But I'm bored. I hate my new job so much. I only work for 2h out of 8h I need to be there. There is no other task I can do and I'm just wasting my time like everyone in the team. The salary was increased, but with all the deductions and benefits (like retirement that I will probably never touch in my life since I will work until 100 years old), I make almost the same as what I was doing working at my older job.

I feel stuck.

On one hand, I want to quit, but I don't want to return to minimum wage. I worth much more than that. I'm 31 and I just failed my entire life. All jobs here in Canada require 3-5+ years of experience, even junior jobs. I apply to them anyway, but I'm just being ghosted.

I could go back to school, but I don't see any good perspective in any field I'm interested into, or it always require 5-7+ years of experience. I just feel doomed at this point.

In the meantime, I try to volunteer to build up my experience, but I'm being ghosted from that too.

I could start my own business, but as I posted earlier this year on Reddit, people think my idea is stupid, so at this moment, everything is on hold.

Thank you for reading even if you don't care. I just want to have a job I like doing and have enough money to live on my own.",jobs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1k9x0w7/i_feel_stuck/,1745850819.0

1k9w90u,Tips for relocating for work when you’re broke,"I’ve been unemployed for six months following a layoff. My savings have been all but depleted and my credit score is in the process of being repaired, so I’m very restricted financially.

This opportunity would be an amazing next step in my career, the salary and benefits are more than generous, and I genuinely feel reinvigorated about life when discussing this potential job vs any of the other jobs I’m interviewing for. The big issue I’ve been stressed about, of course, is trying to figure out if I can actually afford to accept this job if I received the offer (I’m in late stage interviews). The salary would be more than enough to afford rent in the area, but being able to afford to actually move and secure an apartment with little to no funds and rough credit beforehand is what’s making me apprehensive.

1k9vbc7,I have an interview for a custodian position tomorrow. Need advice on how to handle previously being on disability,"I (38M) was working as an electrical apprentice with my local IBEW chapter for about 4 years. But just over 2 years ago I ended going on disability for my back. I didn't have an accident or anything, no workers comp, I just ended up needing surgery. During this time I was studying software development, because I honestly didn't like the people in the IBEW and wanted to make a change, but that has obviously not beared any fruit. When I looked into going back to the IBEW out of desperation, I was told I had taken too long I was no longer in the program, even though I was still paying my dues and no one ever told me about any kind of timeline.

1k9u1y4,"Good job, good salary, good company — still feeling burned out. Is it just me?","It might be the case for many people here, but I wanted to ask openly—how do you deal with it?

For context, I’m a **Staff Engineer** working at a **medium-sized startup based in the US**. I have decent savings that could easily support my current lifestyle for the next 2 years if I decided to step away. Work-wise, I’m in a good place: the team is supportive, the product is great, and the pay is better than most offers I'd likely get if I resigned. Honestly, on paper, everything looks ideal.

But in reality, the constant daily updates, reviews, presentations, and pressure to *always* show tangible output have started overwhelming me.  
It’s not that I hate my work—I actually enjoy what I do. I just feel drained when every move is monitored or needs immediate validation.  
From the company’s perspective, I completely understand—monitoring is necessary because not everyone works sincerely. But personally, it’s exhausting.

Some days it gets too much, and I end up taking random leaves just to mentally recover. I'm trying my best to balance things, but with a 1-year-old kid, a working husband, and a home to run, it feels like we’re just surviving each day rather than living it.

Exercise, meditation, journaling—all the good habits I know could help—just end up getting pushed aside. Maybe it’s procrastination, maybe it's the mental load from work that's constantly running in the background.

**I also realize** that a lot of people are in far tougher situations right now—given the economy, layoffs, and hiring freezes, many would probably love to have the problems I’m complaining about.  
I completely get that my situation is comparatively much better—and that makes me feel even more confused about why I'm struggling mentally.

Has anyone else faced something similar?

* How do you draw boundaries without looking like you’re not serious about work?
* How do you bring back mental clarity when you *can't* afford a full break immediately?
* Any small routines or mindset shifts that helped you avoid full-on burnout?

Would love to hear honest, real-world suggestions from people juggling career, home, and kids.  
Thanks in advance!

Problem was the HR girl. It seemed like she googled questions to ask me. One question was “where do you see yourself in 5 years”. Ridiculous question, but my answer was at a senior or manager position (the job was mid-senior). Another question was “do you know how many employees we have? (It’s a worldwide corporation). I was in disbelief on why she would ask me this, I said that I don’t know but I studied their portfolio, know them from the industry I was working before and I also looked at their history and ownership structure. I felt like apart from these stupid questions from her side, the interview went OK. Last question from her side was to confirm my expected salary, I said that I have a different offer and asked for 8% more (and expected a counter offer in the event they hire me). 

Today they let me know they are proceeding with someone else. I can’t understand why. My profile matches their expectation, I was told twice that I’m their top candidate and after the interview they just let me know they don’t want me. This job involves travelling, and I even have the perfect geographical position for them. 

I’m devastated, this was my dream job, from the job duties through career advancement and learning new things to how it would look in my cv in the future. I feel like I will not find this kind of job anymore in the industry that I’m interested in. Everything matched, the requirements, the work regime, benefits…

I had a mental breakdown after hearing the news just this morning. I see no way I will find a similar job anymore. I have severe anxiety from job searching, and interviewing (however I can compose myself very well and handle it professionally).

I even asked for feedback via mail, no response. Recruiter is not even picking up my phone.

How do I deal with this? What could I have possibly messed up? The decision was up to the hiring manager I think and I see nothing that could cause him to throw me away, especially since I was marked as the top candidate and posess all of the skills they ask for.

Edit: I called the recruiter the day after the interview to confirm some details about the job. He said that in his opinion everything was said in the interview but confirmed what I was asking and I confirmed my big interest.",jobs,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1k9r3ne/top_candidate_interview_went_well_not_hired/,1745831248.0
1k9qzy1,A Delayed Internship Opportunity and Its Aftermath,"Earlier this month, I received an email from a tech company where I had applied for their summer Software Engineering internship last year. Given the time that had passed since I sent my application, I assumed they had forgotten about me. However, while checking my email earlier this month, I was surprised to see they had finally responded to me after months.

The email was from a recruiter who mentioned he wanted to check if I was still interested in the position and asked me to let him know so we could proceed with the next steps. I replied, expressing my strong interest in the role and including a few questions since this would be my first internship and, technically, my first job in tech (I didn't mentioned that in the email tho). I sent the response four days after receiving their email, as I needed time to process the situation and decide what to say.

After replying to the recruiter, I didn’t hear back for a while. Nearly two weeks after my initial response, I sent a follow-up email, noting that I hadn’t received a reply and reiterating my interest in the position. Someone suggested that the reason for the delay might be that they had chosen another candidate, and they turned out to be correct.

Five days after my follow-up email, I received a response from the recruiter. It read: 

""I wanted to touch base and say thank you for investing the time in connecting with us regarding the Software Engineering Intern role. We know how incredibly time-intensive looking for a new job can be, and we thank you for adding us to the list of places you would consider growing your career. Unfortunately, at this time, the hiring team has decided to move forward with other candidates. We encourage you to keep an eye on our careers page for other roles of interest or to connect on LinkedIn to stay in touch. I will also be sharing your information with other teams for potential opportunities. Let's keep in touch!""

At first, I thought the LinkedIn suggestion was a load of crap, given how LinkedIn is often viewed. 

After reading it, I felt disappointed, but given the amount of time that passed between my first email that I sent them, my expectations were low. But, to sum up everything, what now? I'm very new to the job market, and I know about the current tech recession happening, and at the time it was very lucky of me for them to reach out to me given the economy, and I was very looking forward to working with them because I knew it would look great on my resume.

1k9qqey,Am I rejected? Should I follow up?,"Just had an interview last Wednesday and I'm anxious on how terrible it went.

First (recruiter) and second (manager) interview went well I believe. For the third (head of HR) and fourth (senior specialist) I think was terrible. Interview was 3pm, and recruiter asked me arrive a little early because some set up needs to be done. I promised to arrive 2:40pm. On my first and second interview, it only took me 20 mins to reach, but this 3rd and 4th (done the same day), taxi I rode had a wrong turn and had to do a far U-turn so I was late on my promised time. It took me 40 mins. I arrived 2:55pm, and foolish and overthinker me I know 😓 I justified to the recruiter why am I late (even not needed) and seems like he didn't took the justification well and his reaction for me was like ""yeah right"" (though he didn't say this explicitly, I felt he was a little disappointed why I need to justify) that it seems like he thinks I was lying.

Then 3rd interview with head of HR, I think I did great but she didn't maximize the 30 mins time for it, we finished in 20mins only. There are some questions as well maybe that I answered not so nicely. I read somewhere that if the interviewer didn't maximize the time, they're not interested. 😔 4th interview, the interviewer was not smiling, no small talk, and there were a lot of dead air as she types in her Mac the things I say so there were lots of times that I'm already done speaking and she was still typing so there's dead silence. She asked me tons of questions too, very technical, and tbh there were some that I stuttered and I feel I didn't deliver properly. 😓

I know my worth, I know I might not be the best speaker (especially English is not my first language) but I always get the job done and even always extend extra mile, I am 5 years in my current company, but my pay is not justifiable with the load of tasks that I do that's why I'm moving and company is in financial difficulty. I really want this new job as it offers 50% more of my current salary and with lots of benefits.

They said they're gonna do a debriefing of all the candidates and I was the last to be interviewed. It's been almost a week and I haven't still heard anything from them even if after the interview I sent a thank you note. They weren't able to mention when they're going to get back to me and nervous me wasn't able to ask too. 🤦‍♀️

Now, I can't focus on my current work as well thinking maybe I was already rejected, but I really want this job. 😓 If it's fine, should I follow up? If yes, when? And how can I ease my anxiety? 😔

1k9qmkp,Advice for a graduate student,"I am European, 29F and about to graduate with a MSc from a Governance Faculty from a European University. 

My job experience is varied, to say the least. I have almost 10 years of full time hospitality experience where I made it to Assistant Manager, I worked in a grocery store during Covid and I also have 4 student work experiences. I also do social media coordination for a small business. 

I am looking to relocate to Ireland once I finish my thesis, as in my country, salaries are stagnant and quite low in comparison to Ireland. However, all of my job applications have been unsuccessful. I've had two interviews where I was rejected because ""my skills and background do not match the job requirements"", where one of the jobs literally wanted eighter a degree or 2 years of work experience. 


I feel like I'm simultaneously over and under qualified for the market.. I don't want to go back to the hospitality industry because I have studied for 4 years, and I have been told that I am over qualified for those roles, yet I have very little corporate administration experience to qualify for an office position. 

I do not understand what I am doing wrong. Would someone be able to point me in the direction of an HR/Recruitment advisory individual who can review my CV and maybe help me with my interview skills?

1k9p3f7,Need script answers for questions after telling my boss I am leaving (need soon).,"I’m preparing to have that conversation with my boss today.

While she’s always maintained professionalism, she tends to share news heavily peppered with her opinions with many of our office staff (my peers) under her quickly. 

By the time I hang up the phone it will be about 10-15 min before she texts all of them the “guess what I just learned” news. She has often called them to celebrate or bemoan people leaving in the past etc. 

I’m mindful of how the information might be relayed and want to ensure I communicate my departure on my own terms, friendly with scripted answers prepped that don’t seem like a lie or too grey. 

I have a polite script ready, but I’m uncertain how to handle follow-up questions without divulging too much. I do want to come back and work here in the future.

1k9p26m,I need help but feel so conflicted,"I moved to a new city and started a manager job at one of the busiest restaurants in the city. 

I have 13 years total experience in the industry. Did BOH management and FOH. Right now I’m currently both, as are 4 other managers. Chef reports to us too etc. basically all AGM’s. My GM is a psychotic person. He is always so aggravated from doing coke all the time and just pops in whenever he wants and doesn’t really help. Just walks around and orders everyone around. 
He is also extremely unreasonable. He always thinks of the worst when someone can’t make it to their shift or is running late. One of my bartender’s dad went to the hospital and she left mid shift for it. (We had other bartenders there completely capable of covering). In our manager meeting he brought her up and basically compared her to someone who faked being sick etc. Says he can’t help but always think of the worst.

I am frustrated because I have been there for 9 months and still have to close every single night because I’m the “new one”. I am extremely exhausted and work 9-10 hours shifts while the other managers work 6-7 hours in the morning/afternoon.
And it’s all according to tenure. 

I have no life and my partner works 9-5. I am extremely depressed and exhausted. I have brought it up to the other managers and they’ve never offered to switch shifts or take turns. 

I feel like there is no solution than to just quit. Because if I ask my GM he will tell me because of tenure and probably laugh about it after. 
This job pays really well and I have health insurance and vacation time etc.

For context I am looking to leave my current position and head back out to the West Coast (currently East). I currently work for Company A, a sort-of start-up (10yrs old I might add) with plenty of funds raised. I saw a post on LinkedIn for Company B and as soon as I submitted my application I received a request to interview.

I was of course incredibly elated, the pay was beyond my expectations and the thought of moving back out west got me pretty excited. The next day, I interviewed with Company B and they asked if I knew who they were. ""Of course! You're one of the top X firms..."" yada, yada...it was music to the interviewers ears. Then, he stopped and said ""Oh no, I just looked up Company A and it seems we might have a direct affiliation with them...I am unsure we can continue."" I was so shocked and thought, ""Why didn't he look up Company A before we had our interview?""

Anyways, he abruptly ended the interview since he had concern over ""conflict of interest"" and said he would reach out once he had clearance to further chat with me. About 30min later, I get an email from him saying something along the lines of ""I do apologize, we will not be able to continue our conversation due to confidentially and a non-compete you may have signed. Thanks for your time!""

I immediately called my lawyer friend and forwarded him the email, and he said while I do not have an active non-compete in place, currently working for Company A will make it seem like Company B is poaching me for information/trade/etc. because there is an apparent shared board member??

Not sure if anyone has experience with this at all, but needless to say I'm very disappointed.

TL;DR: Company A (current company) and Company B (company I interviewed with) have a shared Board member and I was not moved past the first interview due to ""conflict of interest"". Anyone else have some insight into something similar?

I've been working at a dentist office for the past 2 years now which is also ironically the only time I have ever had to pay taxes. The first year I thought it was weird but I was also making a lot more money than years prior and it was only like $150 federal and $4 state so it stung but I brushed it off and paid and moved on. This year I have to pay $387 federal and $170 state. So obviously the red flags are flying and I start trying to research what's going on. My W-2 is accurate so I start checking my paychecks through ADP Gross to Net calculator and according to that my tax deductions have been off this while time it said that the state and federal taxes were not being taken out correctly. I reach out to my boss on March 30th asking if we could talk during work the next day and he calls me so we briefly discussed what was going on and he asked me to give him the paperwork I had been done my math on and to put it on his desk and he had a meeting with his CPA the next day and would speak with him to find out what was going on. I put the papers on his desk the next morning like he asked and he came to work and left without taking them. I thought maybe I heard wrong and it was the next day he had the meeting but it still bothered me because these papers had all of my details on them and didn't just want them to be out for everyone to see. They sat there for a week and a half until I finally just took them off his desk because it clearly didn't matter to him and he wasn't taking them. It was until then that he finally told me that finally told me he didn't have an answer for me yet he was still trying to figure it out. I figured it would've been figured out at least before we got paid again that way it would be fixed before then but we've now gotten paid two times since then with still no word as to why my pay is messed up. This has cost me too much money and he doesn't care much to resolve this issue. I am currently looking to move on somewhere else but need advice on what I should do.

Hi everyone,

I'm currently unemployed with a gap of almost 7 months.
I previously worked in auditing at an IT company, but it wasn't giving me any growth. Earning only 3 LPA is very little to survive in today's economy.
Although I have been trying to learn languages like Python, C++, and C#, I'm struggling to study them and feel like I'm not good at coding.

I feel like a failure. I have wasted 7 months enrolling in multiple Udemy courses but completed none.
I've been overthinking a lot and now feel like I'm not good at anything.
Can someone help me in this situation?
If there are any work-from-home jobs that pay at least 5–6 LPA and provide training while on the job, I would be happy to work.

I'm also not interested in pursuing higher education because, first, I don't have the money to enroll in courses, and second, I'm not really good at studying.
I really don't want to work in BPO jobs either.
Are there any jobs that can actually help me shape my skills?

1k9iab2,Question Getting an Master's in Public Administration Abroad,"Hi everyone,

I graduated just shy of two years ago with a bachelor's degree in journalism from a university here in the US, where I'm a citizen. I studied abroad in England during my time in college, and haven't stopped thinking about my time there ever since. I currently have a job in marketing, but I'm nervous that it will be harder to get into the 70-80k salary range with my current qualifications (a plethora of internships, my singular undergraduate degree, etc.) and I've been considering getting a Master's in Public Administration, perhaps overseas in either Ireland or England. The allure of completing the degree overseas would be a. getting to be abroad again b. cheaper price c. shorter program duration. I do, however, need to consider my return on investment. My questions are: 1. do you think having a master's degree from an international university would make US employers less likely to hire me in the future ? and 2. Do you think an MPA is worth the time/money in this economy/in this field? As far as what I would want my future career to look like, I would want a managerial role in a communications/marketing field.",jobs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1k9iab2/question_getting_an_masters_in_public/,1745798593.0
1k9ifow,Jobs for someone with PTSD/social anxiety,"**Long story short**, I had a traumatic brain injury that left me with some brain damage and social anxiety. When I’m out in public, I unconsciously perceives threats everywhere. It manifests as a racing heart, high blood pressure, dissociation, cloudy thinking, and awkward body language.

I’m physically imposing (I work out at home) and have a shaved head to save money. So when my anxiety flares up, people notice my body language and either feel threatened or think I’m weird, which makes social situations tough.

I take medication and see a therapist, but it only helps to a certain degree.

**I’m looking for job options** that would work with my situation. I was thinking of night shifts or late afternoon roles where there are fewer people to deal with. I don’t mind being upfront with employers about my health issues, I’ve found that people are often more understanding when I explain things. Not everyone gets it, but it helps take the pressure off me.

1k9hwyj,Is it wrong to quit a job after only two weeks?,"I’ve started a 3 month contract at a large financial company. The job spec I applied for detailed clerical duties such as ordering office supplies, managing calendars, administration etc. 

In the interview, they said I’d also be doing administration for a project they are running, and that I’d be the sole person doing the admin and communications for it. I said I am good with updating a tracker and confident in my administration skills. It was different to the job spec I applied for, but it seemed manageable. 

Two weeks into the job, it’s been a shit show. I’ve had no proper onboarding, no training specific to the project I’m meant to be working on. I’ve been joining some other persons training sessions who has joined the call centre, so all I’ve learnt are call handling skills - which I don’t want to know. 

I’ve been given very little information or direction on the scope of the project I’ll be managing, and am now being tasked with creating tables to report weekly statistics on the project. It is not my strong suit, but I’m trying my best to learn. 

I don’t understand the specifics of my role, my a manger doesn’t even live in the same country as me. I feel very alone, and the job is not what I thought it was going to be at all. 

I’m wondering how I can quit, and if I need to give notice or if i can just walk away.

1k9c3m4,should i be a doctor or an architect?,"hi everyone! i'm a middle school student (14, year 9) living in Hong Kong and my school follows the ib program, so things that everyone may expect me to know about, such as GPA, AP classes and such, i probably don't. i probably shouldn't be worrying about this so early, but i believe that if i know the path im following, i can prepare myself better for college applications, the work expectations and so. also, i have already decided i dont want to relocate when im older, so i think i would have to get a degree that is applicable to Hong kong, such as in the UK?

as a student, i get average grades in class. i'm trying to improve, but i just find it so difficult to do well in classes where the grades could be up to the teacher's interpretation of my work. for example, English and inso (kind of like social studies). in these classes, i find that the rubric is not truly a solid thing that tells me what i must to, unlike math, where the rubric/test genuinely tests ur ability to understand or do the work. classes i do well in are math, science and french. generally, i never get under a 5 on the ib grading scale. my weakness are writing cohesively and smoothly, which contributes to my bad English and inso grades, while my strengths are in more literal classes such as Science and math. i really hope people understand what i mean by literal classes and interpretive classes. i know this is bad, but i don't do any sports, but that isn't by biggest concern right now as i am a healthy weight, and id rather focus on my academics. i am a mainly art focused person. i've been painting since i was a toddler, so my parents are supporting me by helping me try to start a non-profit organisation to raise money. i have kind of bad procrastination problems and im also kind of lazy.

first, doctor.
this is the job that lines up more with my interests. i have already decided that the more specific type of doctor i would want to be would be an anaesthesiologist. the reason i want to be an anaesthesiologist is because i consider myself strong at mathematics, which i think is important for calculating the dosage. if i'm being completely honest, one of the main reasons i wanna be an anaesthesiologist is because of the high salary, im aware of the many years of schooling i have to do along with residency before i become a real doctor. in science, i get 6 and above in most of my tests. in the 3 main fields of science, i wouldnt say i really have a weakness. i enjoy science classes and i find it easy to understand concepts when my teacher is a good explainer. i know i might sound like i'm in it purely for the high salary, but i promise i genuinely have passion and find interest in the medical field. the main things i have concerns about are the long college process and the UCATs. i'm afraid that during the long college process, i will somehow have a burnout and not want to be a doctor anymore, but i would be too far in to quit and find another well paying job i. actually want to do. i am also concerned about my work/life balance both during schooling and when i am a real doctor. would i have enough time to manage/keep up my hobbies? if i have kids in the future, would i be able to spend enough time with them to have a good relationship? this is kind of much to ask for, but could anyone explain their whole experience of year 9 until they became a doctor? it doesn't need to be super detailed, but i feel like it would help me a lot if i knew the full process, since i literally wouldn't have known residency even existed if my friend didn't tell me. 

second, architect.
this is the job that lines up more with my hobbies. i'm a really artistically focused person. i'm basically a hobby hoarder when it comes to arts and crafts. i draw, sew, make random projects, clay model, crochet... i probably sound like an entitled person for saying this, but i know i'm genuinely good at artsy things and i'm above average in this focus for my age. if anyone wants to see my drawings/art or anything, i'll post a link for them if enough people ask. i have also taken classes before to learn design, and i have experience with apps like blender, photoshop, illustrator, and a little bit of experience with Rhino 3d, but i am a little rusty with all of them since i haven't opened any of them for a year now. my biggest concern is the salary of this job. i don't know if this is a reliable source, but according to google, architects in hong kong only make around a third of the salary of an anaesthesiologist. in the future, i want a nice life with lots of money so i can spoil my parents and give my kids the best life ever, with a big family with a nice home with a pretty view and a pool. i have completely no idea regarding the process of becoming an architect. is there something similar to the UCATs or residency, like when you become a doctor? another thing pushing me to becoming an architect is that if if i didn't, i would waste my talent and skill in the artistic field. i wont elaborate much on this, but all the hours and days i spent on my artistic hobbies and focusing on genuinely improving my visual art skills would be wasted, and thinking of that genuinely makes me sad.

i'm so sorry if i made any incorrect assumptions when talking about the experiences of these jobs, to be honest , i barely know anything about what i need to do in the future to become a doctor, and i am aware picking 2 jobs from nearly completely opposite fields is really difficult and will definitely change the course of my life. could anyone help me? should i even be deciding at my age?

don't be afraid to comment something you think i wont care about. anything at all helps! i will be really really grateful for any help i receive in any way, but i'm specifically looking for:

- personal experience with going through muddle school, high school, with their focus specifically being on either of these careers
- things i should be aware of before deciding (work schedules, impacts on my mental health, burn out in the middle of getting your degree...)

- for anaesthesiologists/doctors who would know: what do anaesthesiologists usually do during surgeries? do they need to be watching the patients vitals for the entire duration of the surgery, or can they sometimes watch the surgeon working and check back every few minutes, like if the beeping starts changing? what's the chance that your patient would die under anaesthesia, or what do you do if your patient starts showing weird signs during surgery?
- for architects: what do you do at your job, if it purely using your computer to 3d design spaces? or do you also make a lot of models like college students would? do most of you work from home or in office?

1k9bht4,What are the strangest (but high paying) remote jobs you’ve heard of?,"I don’t mean “remote” as in “work from home”. I mean “remote” as in “only accessible by helicopter or ATV”.

For context, I’m a 24 year old Canadian who cannot find work anywhere within my country. I’d like to spend the next few years of my life doing something adventurous and high paying, ideally with X amount of weeks on, X amount of weeks off, and I’m looking for suggestions so that I can start my application process.

1k99ipt,my job isn't terrible but the work kills me,"I've been working in the insurance industry for about 5 months now — it's my first job out of college. Honestly, I never planned on going into insurance, but I applied somewhat randomly, the interview went well, and I ended up getting hired.

The pay is decent, and I get to work from home 3 days a week, which is a nice perk. I work with a team, and we all help service and sell under our manager’s book of business. The work itself isn’t incredibly difficult, but the days can feel pretty draining. It's a lot of nonstop emailing — going back and forth with 30+ agents, constantly requoting and troubleshooting little issues. It feels very administrative at times.

To be honest, I don't feel like I'm building a lot of transferable skills, and it’s hard for me to picture myself staying in this role long term. At the same time, my team is genuinely amazing. They’re supportive, caring, and we have a lot of fun with team events and outings. They even took me out for a birthday lunch, which meant a lot.

I guess my question is: when do you know it's the right time to leave a job? Especially when you like the people but not the work? I don’t want to make a rash decision, but I also don’t want to feel like I’m just wasting time either.

1k92rkh,I dont know what to do work wise,"Before i start i apologise about spelling and grammar.
So four years ago I moved to Scotland to change my life,I found a job and was doing well but after a short while I noticed I was being treated differently, fast forward a year and a half I had an accident and had to leave that job but at that point I was glad i did,I've since been diagnosed with ADHD,autism AND fibromyalgia.
Every job I've had has left me physically,mentally or financially much worse off than when I started,for example before I moved I was a key worker and was left in thousands worth of debt AND a ripped tendon from the top of my back to my stomach,I could go on like that with all my jobs.

I have ZERO skills and always had to do physical jobs,I don't know how to use computers (I'm completely IT illiterate) even though I have done customer service in the past i have been abused and even threatened with knives and guns in a previouse job so I cannot do customer service jobs as I have no time for people anymore.

My only hobby used to be American muscle cars of which of course I cannot and will never afford those again,I've tried every hobby I've had a slight interest in, my last being photography but I've given that up as I wasn't progressing.

I've been looking into remote jobs from home but again not a single job I feel I could do,I've even looked at dog walking but looking after somone else's animal would annoy me like don't have a dog if you don't have time for it (that's how my brain works) and I don't like babies or children do no chance of that.

I've always struggled work wise but with my experiences over the past I feel like there is probably nothing for me anymore.

1k95brd,I have two work from home job offers. I am unsure about them.,"Hi. I'd appreciate if anyone could help me out here. I have two offers and I am not sure about them. Neither is great but I've been unemployed for a while now. Health insurance is similar for both jobs. I've told both companies I value work life balance and they said they don't expect OT.

**Job 1:**

40 hours a week, Monday-Friday 11 am to 7:30 pm. $18.50 per hour. It's a customer onboarding position, so I'd be on calls and helping onboard new customers. They said calls are not timed and there are not really any metrics as long as the customer is satisfied. 

On Glassdoor, it does say that they have recently started doing metrics, but in the interview they said they don't but are considering implementing them. They do post fake Glassdoor reviews. I know this because most are 5 star and seem like HR posts. I did talk to some people on LinkedIn and they did tell me it's a great place but not sure how much that's worth. 

It's a smaller company so not as much room to grow other than a lead position or possibly move into another area. 1.5 weeks of training.

I dislike the schedule as well, and they are not flexible about it. Also the industry and product itself is kind of boring. I don't want to say since I don't want to be identified. Some Glassdoor reviews said the department is a mess and training sucks and they send crappy computers.

Multiple people in the interview said turnover is low and the average tenure for the position is 2 years.

**Job 2:**

40 hours a week, with at least one weekend day and my schedule would change from 9 to 5 or 10 to 6 and I'd work straight through without a break, which I prefer. $20 per hour. Bigger company so more opportunity, and a more interesting industry. They offer a few days more PTO than job 1. The pay is better, and the training is 8 to 10 weeks. I also prefer a 9 to 5 schedule and would save 30 minutes a day compared to job 1.  
  
Up to this point the job seems better than job 1, but there are metrics such as average call time, error rate, etc. They just have a handful of metrics. I have never worked in a call center environment before, so I am not sure how well I'd handle being told I need to be faster on the phone, especially when every customer is different.

There was also a slight red flag to me when one of the interviewers told me she was annoyed by a staff member because they asked a simple question that could be googled. It made me wonder if they have a negative culture, but maybe I am reading too much into it.

Turnover is also low here according to the hiring manager, but I take it with a grain of salt. On Glassdoor, they are a 3.5 whereas job 1 is 4.5, but I am certain job 1 is faking their reviews. The positive reviews on job 2 seem legit. The negative reviews are from years ago, or they are from other departments such as engineering or the drivers. There are 0 negative reviews for the department.

I did have an emergency and had to reschedule an interview and they were really kind and gracious about it. Not sure how much this matters, though.



**Other Thoughts:**

Job 2 seems better on paper, but I am really not used to call center metrics. Job 1 may not have metrics now,  but they are considering implementing them at some point. Working a weekend day is not the biggest deal since I am single and don't plan on having kids. I also would hate the 11 to 730 schedule since my work day is 30 minutes longer and also I'd be mid-shift, which I hate and won't be able to do much at night since I go to bed early.

I am also wondering if the 11 to 7:30 schedule would affect my sleep. I try to fall asleep around 10 pm, and I am not sure if I would be able to wind down enough to fall asleep 2.5 hours after my shift. I am not sure if I am overthinking it, however.

The biggest issue with job 2 is the metrics, but they don't seem terribly unreasonable, especially if I can't find any negative reviews for that department on Glassdoor or Indeed, and the company is the #1 company in the US for what they sell.

What do you think? Am I being unreasonable about the metrics for job 2? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!!",jobs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1k95brd/i_have_two_work_from_home_job_offers_i_am_unsure/,1745764399.0
1k96rrj,"Risk It All for a Potential $100K Job, or Play It Safe? I’m Struggling to Choose","
If anyone who is willing to take the time to read this & give advice, I’d appreciate it so incredibly deeply. I value other people’s perspectives and thoughts with life, and right now I could use all the advice on how to approach this situation. I will be changing the names/company names for privacy purposes of course. 

I currently work at a place called “Big Projects” where the company remodels “kitchens”. I am apart of a small marketing team. Essentially I go to events such as craft fairs, county fairs, farmers markets, etc whatever we can access to get foot traffic. At the events we see if people want to enter for a giveaway. If people are entering I ask if they are thinking about remodeling and if they say yes I explain how we have a free service to give a $ number on the remodel that’s good for one year. Some people set up an appointment for our design rep to come give them that quote. Some people buy the remodel right then. I also call to verify all the numbers people put in for the giveaway, and offer the free service as an appointment to those people then as well. I make hourly, but I also make commission. Every entry I get at an event = $1. Every appointment that happens and does not cancel = $50. Every person who buys the remodel in the appointment = $100. I am part time but paired with the commission a lot of times I was making full time pay for part time work. It was rough in the winter though when business slows down. Things were good for a while, aside for not being able to have my weekends or really get the opportunity to ask unless it’s super occasional and ahead of time enough that we see what event is that weekend and if one of my co workers could cover it. The people I worked with were great for the most part. It started off as 4 girls including me. I actually found a very close friend in the one girl who we hung out on our off days and it was always a blast whenever we got to work an event together or leave the office to go flyer by ourselves. The other girl was very nice and kind. The last girl is a good worker but can be very hard to work with sometimes. The boss well he was a great mentor in a lot of ways but also as time went on I started seeing how he can be manipulative and sometimes he makes out of pocket comments that aren’t the most necessary, at least not for everyone. It’s hard because he really cares about your personal life and goals but he isn’t the most understanding with emotions sometimes. Which I completely get too, working isn’t necessarily about emotions lol. Overall it was a lot of fun though most days with all the banter and laughter. There was a lot of independence I liked too. The nice and kind girl left before the new year due to the boss affecting her mental health. After she left, it was my boss, “Mark”, the co worker I am tight with “Cassie” and the coworker who is a good worker but isn’t always the nicest lol “Kimi”. By the end of January I was starting to consider leaving as I wanted my weekends back, more money, (I was making just enough to survive), benefits, and to not get roasted or picked on for everything I said or did all the time. I agree it is necessary time to time but sometimes it was relentless. Right as mid February hit, I got the flu so I was out for a week. Towards the last day before I was supposed to return to work I messaged Cassie to see what I missed at the office. She said to call Mark and see what’s going on. He told me that basically the admin sexually harassed Kimi saying some not okay things as she was expressing she was uncomfortable and admin would not stop. So Mark went to the owner “Jerry” and explained the situation and how Kimi was not comfortable working with admin now and would leave if admin stayed. Jerry said well we are sorry to see Kimi go then because he was not letting go of admin. The funny thing is admin was looking for a job right until this happened and decided to stay if Jerry allowed her to bring her baby to work. So Mark and Kimi walked out and I had no clue since I was out sick and neither did Cassie as she had a day off when that happened. That weekend Jerry assumed Cassie and I quit too but Mark negotiated us 3 paid days off so we would come back but Cassie and I didn’t really have a say in whether we actually had quit lol. So yeah after this Mark got funding from a friend to start his own company doing the same thing. He offered us 3 girls the same thing but $1 more hourly. Cassie did not want to switch over with him so she found a job with security and left. I had an interview with a place 3 weeks ago but they just called two days ago to offer a second interview but it wouldn’t be for another 3 weeks due to a lot going on in the company. They apologized for the delay and understand if I have other opportunities requiring immediate attention. Right before the called for the second interview offer, mark had asked to meet with me at Dunkin to discuss offering a sale position at his company but I would do marketing like I have been for 6 months and he would train me in sales off the clock and put me in my first appointment. After that 6 month period. He thinks off the bat I’d be better than the worst sales man at big projects and in a year I’d be better than the best sales man. He said I have what it takes to make 100k in a year and showed me how the worst sales rep made $50k commission in the last 4 months which are the slowest months of the year. This is very intriguing. But after thinking for some time I decided it’s too much risk even if the reward is large. I want to take the other position doing graphic design for 60k benefits weekends and pto. Mark has been acting like I am coming over with him despite not giving a hard answer but I just decided today I’m not interested. I am nervous because he said last week he is walking out Thursday and that I can switch my day off on Wednesday for having a day off on Friday so I don’t lose hours my last week at the company before switching to marks. I wasn’t sure how to handle this because I want to stay for jerrry but mark asked my word I didn’t and when I gave my word I was thinking that I wouldn’t stay there long I was only going to stay until I found other work. So essentially I want a job still come Friday but I’m scared to upset mark and how to go about making sure Jerry lets me have a job still. I’m also worried lowkey that if this other job doesn’t work out I don’t want to stay working for Jerry and what if I missed my opportunity with mark.

1k984hj,Struggling to Understand the Numerous Work Visas Issued to Foreign Nationals Amid an Already Crowded U.S. Job Market,"Recently, I have received many direct messages on LinkedIn from individuals who said they plan to move to the U.S. on an L-2 visa. Most of them are from the country that already account for about 80% of H-1B visa allocations. They send me their resumes and ask if I can refer them to my company for job opportunities.

Besides the fact that I don't know how to refer someone I've never met — and who is still overseas — when I review their CVs, I notice they are often packed with an unusually long list of skills and decades of managerial experience, even though their LinkedIn profiles show they are only in their early 30s. This seems questionable to me.

I am also confused about the L-2 visa itself. What are the actual requirements for an L-2 visa holder to work in the U.S., and do they really have ""unlimited"" work authorization? It was supposed to be a opportunity for the US companies to bring their international employees to the US, not providing a job for thier dependents.

More broadly, I wonder why, at a time when we already have a large influx of H-1B and OPT visa holders entering the job market, American citizens and U.S. permanent residents must compete with an even greater number of foreign workers, especially when even recent U.S. graduates are struggling to find jobs.",jobs,72,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1k984hj/struggling_to_understand_the_numerous_work_visas/,1745771642.0

1k956de,In search of jobs with high down time,"I am an artist and a writer with dysthymic depression, and after work, I find my energy so drained it takes a massive effort to get myself to work on my creative endeavors. Doing so makes me exhausted and highly stressed and kind of takes the fun out of my passions. I do however feel most motivated when I'm at a place of work, boredom strikes and I get motivated to create. I would love to establish my own brand online and eventually, that'd be my job, but I have bills to pay now so I need a job that pays now. It's not that I want to do nothing and get paid, it's that the work I am passionate about and want to dedicate my life to doesn't pay. So I'm trying to find a middle ground of ""getting paid to write and make art"" indirectly.

So I would love a job that has rather high down time. I know of some people who've worked jobs like that, and would adore one. Second to creating, that'd be my dream job. Ideally, I'd either 1. Get to work, have tasks to do either by the end of the week or for the day, and once I finish the rest of the time is mine. Or 2. I am paid to be there as customer service at a desk or something like that, and have tons of time in between, just having to put down my creative work for the job I'm paid for when needed. If most days are like this and some are busy, not a problem. I just want a livable wage ($20-$30/hr or $41,600-$62,400 salary) and to do what I really want to be doing for work. I've been working jobs I've hated to pay the bills for 13 years now and I'm sick and tired of it.

If you can give me ideas as to what to search, I'd appreciate it so much. And any ideas of how to get those jobs, as I've been applying for 2 years for new work to no avail. If it means schooling or learning a new skill, that's fine.

•2022: Left job due to declining mental health due to personal tragedy in family. Turns out, shortly after, company got bought so it wouldn't have mattered much. Role would have been eliminated. 
•2023: Immediately land in role with a previous company that was going through management chaos. New manager is the most worthless piece of shit. Stuck it out the whole year but things were so bad I left without back up.
•2024-2025: Suffered 13 mos with minimal income from side hustles and spouse working.
•2025 (end of Jan): Land a PT role with local hardware store. Immediately got to work clawing my way back to a more substantial job. Got two interviews that didn't go well or feel right.
•2025 (end of April): got call back from a job I applied to many many months ago. We clicked in the interview. Got hired and even offered $2 above what I asked just because the owner seemed to really like me.

What worked:

I never once tuned my resume per job. I know that's really popular right now, but that doesn't register in my brain as productive. I stuck to some good old fashioned 2011 resume writing I learned from a neighbor who was a career advisor for Full Sail for many years. 

Indeed was my primary source for job searching. I never got call backs from Zip Recruiter or LinkedIn. Only one interview was from a referral and it was an awful interview. 

I only made one tweak to my resume and it was a Josh Fluke tip. I've been an artist all my life and I do freelance work, so I changed my title from ""owner/freelancer"" to just ""artist"" for my brand. It removes the automatic notion that I'm the owner but rather I work for the name I operate under.

Overall, this job searching we are doing is heavily nuanced, and for me it seemed like it's just a numbers game. Have a well written resume, but I think the edge is being some of the first to apply and maybe even follow up if possible. 

I got the hardware job on a follow up call. It gave the SM motivation to get a new body in there. Don't be afraid to be a squeaky wheel. It was as simple as calling, stating my name, and just saying I was following up to an application and wondered if the role was still open. 

It could also be that you might have already applied to the job you're going to get, but like the one I just got, it took them a long ass time to actually start going through resumes, and I was in the top few of the stack.

I hope this helps some or gives some a glimmer of hope. If you're searching still, just know my heart is with you on this journey because I know. Good luck out there. 🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻",jobs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1k950e8/finally_new_role/,1745763527.0
1k94oc4,Unexpected job offer,"Hi all- 

I graduated college about 2 years ago and had a lot of trouble getting a job so was just looking everywhere for one. While working my last job, I took a test for a city job in September, ranked 8, didn't hear anything. Time goes by I take a social media marketing job at a start up with some people I know. Not hard just monotonous work like posting and captioning videos for social media for a bunch of accounts. Relaxed environment but a lot of work since they are just now building up. 

The city called and offered me a job this week and wants an answer next week. I heard them out just to see & it would be a pay bump, better hours, 12 paid holidays (I really only get Thanksgiving and Christmas at current place), great benefits/pay raises (in a union) and good retirement. Only thing I would be on call for dispatch (just in winter) my family has also worked there so I know how great it can be. This is like a data entry job with some customer facing stuff.

I'm hesitating because both jobs feel like great opportunities. One could turn into something great, and one is guaranteed career job. Right now I have nothing for retirement and current place doesn't have benefits. I also would just feel bad about leaving because they have no one (I would give a month notice) I just wanted to hear what others perspectives might be!",jobs,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1k94oc4/unexpected_job_offer/,1745762568.0

I’m trying to find a job as a personal assistant,receptionist, paid internship or maybe something in retail. I’m trying to stay away from food and more towards office work. I already have experience as a personal assistant, I’ve nannied, volunteered, worked as a travel agent. But I’m clearly doing something wrong I just don’t know what. I’ve applied to over 70 jobs in my area but there is also so much confusion as to where I apply. Some employers ask you apply on indeed, or maybe it’s linkin, maybe it’s their website. Or maybe they have an ad on one website but then when you call they say they don’t even look at that they look at an entirely different website. It’s all so confusing. I genuinely want a job and I want to be proud of the job I chose for myself but what do I do when my self esteem is at an all time low because I’ve gotten absolutely no where. And also I do ask my unsuccessful interviewers what I can do to improve but either one, they don’t answer or two it’s some half ass excuse. For example I had interviewed at a extension salon for a receptionist job and I felt the interview went very well and when I called for an update they had said they wanted someone who planned to peruse the field more meanwhile the lead receptionist who was also in attendance at the interview isn’t perusing any form of cosmology. Not super sure how that makes sense either. If everyone was expected sure I get it but if the lead person isn’t even an example of the expectations you plan to set then why? Put it on an ad idk? Regardless while my post is a bit judgey I’m actually a very big people pleaser. My judgment and questions are genuine but I would never say them out loud. I could just really use some guidance.

I basically had the job. HR told me so on our last conversation. I was internally referred, killed it in the assessment project, killed it in both in-person interviews.

But, after everything (whole process took a bit more than a month), they realised they didn't need that position and decided to hire two people for another open position that had a heavier workload and just remove the one I had applied to.

So much time, energy, didication and sleepless nights of stress were spent on this application. I feel like this was a dirty move, a rug pull from their part.

I don't care what the hours or days are for any job available I just want the freakin job. 

My youngest said to me today ""mommy I'm ready to go home now"" and I nearly died. We've been staying with a friend of mine but we leave every few days and head off to the next place to give everyone some space and today it just really feels like I'll never bounce back.  My babies keep me going yes but how can I dig myself out of this...place if someone won't just throw me a bone? 

I've tried going the shelter route and here In LA they're literally telling people who need housing ""oh well, we're at capacity "" or ""we Don't have any space in any facility that suits your families needs so you have to be put on our waitlist and that has a 6 month waitlist to it.""

WTF IS THAT ABOUT??

The job was losing money I guess and to be frank, we had a lot of people and they kept hiring so they got rid of a lot of people. People were very upset that their friends got fired for some reason. I enjoyed a few coworkers but if they got fired, that's that. It's not my personal problem but some people acted like they were going to talk to the boss about this.

There's a private chat they have with current and previous coworkers. I noticed they bad mouth the company and rightfully so if they feel they were unfairly fired I suppose.

I went ahead and fixed the typo on the website, so the updated resume is now there, but the e-mail I sent to the man still has the error. Now I’m kind of freaking out because I don’t want him to think I’m careless or unprofessional.

1k8vk4r,Considering returning to toxic employer amidst tough job market?,"
I worked for a healthcare company for 3.5 years that had some pretty major red flags. In the time I worked there I received 3 promotions however, my third promotion was very difficult to achieve as the company was moving the goal post on what I needed to do in order to be promoted again. They did this for about a year. They would say that I needed to achieve x goal or meet x KPI and then I would be promoted, but once I achieved those things, management would tell me that upper management won’t promote me until our department achieved x goal.

I became very frustrated with the company and decided to move to another city and work for another office while I looked for other opportunities. Back at my home office (office A) my old manager left and they asked if I could support office A and train the new management from a remote capacity while I transitioned to office B. The company suggested I take my old managers position and asked me what my salary expectations would be if I took his position, but given the way I was treated before, I didn’t want to work for them again. Also, the reason my old manager left was because he too was being stretched thin and the juice wasn’t worth the squeeze. 

The company said that because I was transferring to an office that made less revenue, I would have to take a pay cut unless I received another promotion. They said that if I am successful I will be promoted to the next level, however I wouldn’t receive a raise; it would just be a title change and I would get to keep my previous pay rate.

By this point I had 0 respect for the company and I was just coasting through. I told them I wouldn’t be taking any pay cut and would quit immediately if I did. Months go by and office A finds new managers, who I train. I receive my promotion but get no pay bump. My work life balance at office B is a lot better but I’m doing entry level work for them. I am a high performer and an expert at what I did for the company so I started to feel unchallenged. I decided it was just time for me to part ways with this company entirely and move back home. I say my goodbyes and upper leadership tells me their doors are always open for me, even from a remote capacity if I wanted.

A manager of another department who I viewed as a mentor let me know that I can reach out to them if I ever need a job. The job is a recruitment job and the recruiters there make a lot more money than my previous position and they have a better work life balance.

I’m doing gig work right now while I look for something else but as you may realize this is one of the toughest job markets ever. It’s very difficult to find a job and even though I can coast right now and pay my bills, I’m in a lot of debt and I can’t live the lifestyle I want to.

I’m considering going back to my previous employer despite being taken advantage of/lied to/manipulated. Would you recommend I go back? Have you ever gone back to a previous employer? 

TLDR: My previous employer took advantage of me and didn’t pay me
Adequately enough. A manager offered me a job in another department that would be more pay and better work life balance but it’s still the same company at the end of the day. It would however be an easy way to get a job in an absolutely terrible job market.

I became better friends with maybe three or four of them. Our little group likes superhero comics, sports, tacos, and things like that.

Specifically, there are two attractive benefits Thomson offers, but I'd like to know how much they are actually used by day-to-day employees.

1. The job post says employees can work from a different location for 8 weeks out of the year, including up to four weeks in a non-US location.

Can anyone there please provide insight?
2. Like many companies today , Thomson says they offer ""unlimited"" PTO. Which sounds great but we all know in practical effect it can vary greatly in what it actually means. Sometimes it does mean you can plan vacations and take them, but often it means you can only take vacations when EVERYTHING at the office is dead, and then maybe please check your emails once a day.

1k8rgn9,Asking to be taken on permanently during maternity cover,"Hi all,

I'm on a 15 month maternity cover contract with a new work place. They're a small, family owned business with some outside investment. They are doing OK relative to the rest of the industry they're in, and are stable. 

I'm about a month into the cover. I am really enjoying the job and the people in the workplace. Probably more so than I have enjoyed a job in a decade. 

The person i am covering has a very different skill set to me despite us occupying the same role, there's obviously some overlap. I'm not sure what her plans are re coming back after she has her baby, but let's assume she is.

There is another senior person in the business leaving in the next month. I also have some overlap with her skillset. They don't plan to backfill her role, but rather have a couple of more junior resources in the team stepping up. 

I have a couple of questions.

1. Would it be appropriate to discuss how I can help fulfil some of the gaps the senior person has left at this stage, with a view to taking on some of their responsibilities / leadership? Ideally if I came on full time I'd perform some of this person's duties + some of my current duties. 

2. Re the above, i'd obviously like to stick around post maternity cover, but a pay rise would also be ideal. I took a lower wage as I was returning to work from some time working for myself / starting a family. For the personal goals we have over the next few years I need to be making more money. Do I bring this up as part of the above conversation or later down the line?

As i said I've been with the workplace for a month. I haven't really got any 'runs on the board' at this early stage, but seem trusted / well respected. They also paid a recruiter to hire me, so they may be interested in keeping me around or that is sunk cost?

1k8qg8r,"Need advice about my current job, manager is stopping me from working and I keep getting rejected from AI in other jobs","Hey guys, 19 year old here. I’m really stuck and in a shitty situation.
I’ve been employed at Target since 2022, things were going well and I was getting a lot of shifts.
Unfortunately the good manager left at the start of 2024. 
Fast forward to February 2025 and I just suddenly stop getting shifts. I haven’t had any for about 3 months. 
I went to another Target store asking for a transfer, they told me to tell my manager to send my details to them so they can employ me. 
So I went back to my store to speak to my manager, I explained the situation and politely asked if she could send my details.
She gave me a glare and suddenly
 “that’s YOUR job to send the resume to them, I’m not doing it for you. It’s not my problem”

I told her that’s what they asked me to do, she goes “nah they wouldn’t of”

She was so passive, and I did not expect that. 
It infuriated me when she said this:
“Also you can’t just float around in the back office waiting for me. When you’re not working I don’t consider you an employee. You are a CUSTOMER, leave now”
Then she walked over to the door, and held it open. I left in shock. 
Even when people asked me to cover their shifts through the target app, that manager always REFUSES IT. 
So yeah, I really don’t know what to do. Any chance I get she refuses the shift.
I’ve tried applying for other jobs but it’s the same old shit “we’ve decided to progress other candidates” even when I mention I have EXPERIENCE with Target. I’m fucking sick of it.

Apologies for the long rant and I appreciate anyone who has read through all of this.

I first thanked them for letting me know i didn't get the job but I am curious to why i wasn't selected. They actually emailed me back and said that although my resume is good, My job history shows I don't stay at places long enough and its a red flag. Now this maybe something obvious to a lot of people but nobody around me before brought that up to me. It really helped me restructure my resume to get rid of that red flag.

I’ve been applying for jobs since then, got lots of interviews but zero offers.

It’s very stressful and disappointing; I’d like to know moms who had similar experience- how long did it take you to get a job after baby’s birth? The reason I ask is to know how long postpartum is acceptable for employers to hire new moms. I have to disclose that I am a new mom because every prospective employer has asked the reason for the 6-months employment/how my last employment ended. 

Unfortunately, I have to include this 6-months employment job on my resume for 2 reasons: my attorney (I hired an attorney to negotiate the Severance pay only because she said I wouldn’t be able to sue the employer successfully) said I’d be considered lying for not including it on my resume; I signed a Severance Agreement that requires me to disclose this document to my future employer for the next 2 years.

1k8p7bl,How the hell do you get a barista role??,"Hello everyone 👋,

I've been applying to mostly barista and admin assistant jobs lately and had some interviews that I thought went pretty well. For context, I’m a community college student graduating in May. I’m planning to take 6–7 months off to work and save up before transferring to a university in January 2026 (since college is insanely expensive).

I’ve worked as a math and reading tutor at an education center where I handled customer service every day — working with students, communicating with parents, answering questions, and helping with scheduling. I'm used to busy environments and customer interactions, even if it wasn’t food or coffee specifically.

In the interviews, I stayed honest, professional, and friendly — but I’m naturally a lot more serious and quiet. Not rude or cold, just not super bubbly or performative. A few of the coffee shop interviewers (especially at newer places) really emphasized wanting someone ""super outgoing, fun, and upbeat."" One even asked me, “If you were to star in a movie, what genre would it be?” I answered honestly, saying probably horror because of my serious/deadpan vibe, but afterward I realized they were probably looking for a much louder, more hyped-up personality.

It’s frustrating because these are entry-level coffee jobs or admin assistant, and it feels like being calm, reliable, and good with customers should count more than whether you can act like a hype machine at the drive-thru window. Is it really that common for coffee shops to prioritize ""huge energy"" over actual work skills and customer service experience? Or is it mostly newer/trendier places trying to build a brand?

Would love to hear from anyone who didn’t fit the loud, bubbly stereotype but still found a good barista job. Feeling a little discouraged but trying to stay realistic about where I might fit best.",jobs,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1k8p7bl/how_the_hell_do_you_get_a_barista_role/,1745707212.0

1k8ovjw,I found a job! - Here are some fun* stats and tips,"I started looking for a job recently and when I did, one of my first moves was to look to Reddit for some help. What I saw was a lot of ""there are no jobs"" and ""why is no one hiring"" I did see one tip about making a spreadsheet to keep track of where and what you have applied for (either here or r/jobsearchhacks ) that I used and I wanted to share the information, because I would've like to see it when I started looking. 

TL:DR - Apply a lot and often, no response is normal. 

The Background: I started looking a few weeks ago, I finally hit my breaking point at my current job. Current position: Warehouse Manager. I was looking for a similar position, knowing titles are not consistent across businesses, I was looking for: Warehouse Manager or Supervisor, Operations Manager or Supervisor, and in some cases I applied for ambiguous titles like ""Leader"" and ""Coordinator"" when the pay was in my range or the description made it seem like it was what I was looking for. 

The Numbers: 

101 - Applications - This is the grueling part. I applied for at least 2 hours every night and on the weekends. Into week 2 I made the arbitrary goal of 8/ day.

24 - Days of searching

27 - Rejections - Most will not contact you, which makes sense, but I wish I knew it going in.

10 - Phone screens

8 - Messages - either email or DM on Linked/ Indeed

4 - Interviews 

3 - Jobs I turned down - Pay range wasn't posted for 2 of them, and it was much lower than I could go to. The other was a bait and switch, the position was posted for my area (SE Michigan) but when they called for the phone screening, the second question was ""If selected, do you have the means to move to Florida within 10 days of an offer?"" This was not noted in the posting.

1 - Offer 

Some tips I wish I had:

1. Apply a lot. It truly is a numbers game. 10% of my applications resulted in even a phone screening. Even if the job you're applying for isn't ""perfect"" at worst it can be interview practice. I'll also throw in here, use a spreadsheet to keep track. It doesn't have to be in-depth as to have when you've gotten a call, but just knowing where you've applied is huge. It'll prevent from overlapping if utilizing multiple job sites.

2. Prepare for phone screenings. All but 2 of the screenings I had were scheduled beforehand. Use that time to research the company, at least a little. It caught me off-guard to be asked ""what do you know about us?"" and it really shouldn't. Also, the spreadsheet helps with the question ""why are you interested in (position) in (industry)?"" Because I am coming from a fairly niche industry, I got the question a lot, and I didn't always have the greatest answer. I doubt it cost me any opportunities, but it could've made me look better by being prepared. This is also where tracking applications can be useful, when you have a call with company X for position Z, you won't be surprised because you've applied for so many jobs. 

3. Utilize LinkedIn/ Indeed. This is probably a no-brainer in 2025, but I had to be told by a more professional friend to clean mine up. They are great aggregators of jobs in your area and the recruiters/ HR personnel that perform the phone screenings before you meet with a hiring manager do look at these profiles. Make sure your profile is up to date, and in some cases it even speeds up the application process.

4. Be patient. I know mine was fairly quick and I was in the best situation, still employed and looking on my terms, but I found it super stressful so I'm sure it's worse and someone is searching and not able to make ends meet. I applied for things that I would've hated, the commute would've sucked or was ""just a little"" lower than my minimum pay requirements. This was after not getting any feedback for what felt like years. I had a 9pm interview for an 11pm-8a shift that when I left for it, my wife said ""if you get this, are you really going to replace one miserable work experience for another?"" I still did the interview for practice, but after that, I realized even though I feel desperate, I have to have some standards. 

5. Be prepared for anything. I'm going to get into it, but the interview part was the least of my concern, but one had me thrown all the way off. It was 4 people in a room behind laptops that took turns asking me questions, it was clinical and very different from anything I've experienced, so I bombed.



Once i got into the interview, I felt like (for the most part) I knew what to do, because I know what I look for. I've been a hiring manager for a few years now and have hired plenty of people. 

The best tips I have as a hiring manager (that isn't be on time)

Be yourself - If you are at the point of a face-to-face interview with a manager, you have at least the minimum qualifications, you've likely been screened to get there. Every person I've hired, I clicked with personally or they stood out in some way or they seemed genuinely good to be around everyday. 

Be prepared - Because I was hiring for a somewhat niche industry, I would ask ""have you looked us up?"" even if they did, they weren't going to find many specifics, but I always liked the effort from the people who said ""yeah, but I couldn't find much about this location"" or something to that effect. 

When asked ""do you have any questions"" have something - Specifically, have something that isn't (or don't lead with) ""what is the PTO policy"" This will be dependent on the job/ field you're looking in. In my world, and especially for elevated positions, a question like ""what recent process improvement has the team gone through that you're proud of?"" or ""are there any special projects going on?"" This always made it feel like the person wasn't just showing up for another interview they didn't really care about. 



I hope someone finds any of this helpful, also if anyone wants some more specific interview advice, I'd be glad to help, shoot me a DM and I'll help as much as I can.",jobs,2,https://i.redd.it/460w412l89xe1.png,1745706244.0

1k8o6c5,9 years at my current position & need a sense of direction,"I need some advice on what to do cause I feel lost at my current position.

NOTE: I’ve been in retail since 2012 so I have plenty of retail experience.

I’ve been working at my current employer for just over 9 years, and I feel I’m beginning to hit my “ceiling”. 

I started in the coffee bar back in January 2016 and was there till January 2017 which I transferred to on of our Outlet locations.  During my time in the Coffee Bar, around September-October, the Outlet location I later transferred to needed some help and was willing to offer overtime pay.  So I helped out for a bit and was enjoying the environment and the fast-pace feel that I was working with.  Which is why I later transferred there.

While at the Outlet store for 2.5 years, I knew I wanted to go back and be a sales associate that was commission based because I knew how to work with people.  During my time at the Outlet, I got to open two locations and help them out [overtime], & help at our location at Mall of America when Minnesota hosted the Super Bowl.  I was later “pasted over” for a potential opportunity to be a Floor lead for Men’s and Shoes since that’s what I mostly worked with.  To which I said to my manager, “You can either [Transfer me back] or you can fire me; and we can play it either way”.  Shortly after that, an opportunity to work in a sales role came up to which I jumped at the opportunity and transferred back to my original location.

My previous roll, I was handling rental Tuxedos & Suit for weddings/special events.  I have to help give ideas on what would look good with whatever details the bride & groom wanted (unless it didn’t make any sense).  It was a fun process of understanding people’s needs for weddings/events/etc..  My location was one of the top locations in terms of sales.  After about 3.5 years, my manager offered me a roll to work on sales floor to be a full time commission based employee, to which I accepted.

My current roll, I’m working with people to understand their needs & wants for clothing, Styling people, etc. and for the first year it was fun and a great hustle workflow.  I was even in the top 15 sales associates overall in my first year.  My second year was a bit of a dip because of a hire we had that was stealing sales.  He was let go after about 10.5 months, but the damage was done and my sale was severely down.  My third [current] year is somewhat better, but still not as good as my first year.  While I do enjoy helping people out and problem solving, I’m beginning to feel like I’m being under-valued and under-appreciated because of all the new hires they bring in.

While I understand the current environment is changing and unpredictable because of the tariffs,  it is really taking a toll on me and my some of my coworkers.

I wonder if I should still be where I am, or if there are better opportunities for me with my current skill sets.  I would like some ideas or advices on what you think would be ideal for me.

Also, in one case it was a glaring misclassification of what should be a W2 employee under law based on a very specific set of KPIs and expectations on the JD and the other was treading a fine line. 

In both cases, neither guaranteed any compensation and both capped earning potential.

I was told there were many ways to advance but you gotta suck up or be a part of the good old boy club. My girlfriend has said I need to leave because she says I live stressed at this point. My parents give me the old suck it up and keep pushing. But right now I am miserable. 

I dont trust the leadership because they don't hold themselves accountable and instead point the finger somewhere else. Example being the raw materials I use are awful and am told to make do after I complained that this stuff is no good and is going cause problems. We received three shipments of materials that were bad and when it was found my manager was ticked asking why i ran it. When something breaks they want us to fix it while maintenance watches youtube with a supervisor who knows something ain't right (happened this week). 

Physically and mentally, the plant is making me have more headaches and I've felt more anxious than I ever. My sciatica and foot injuries from the military are worse. I nearly passed out from heat exhaustion last year. And the plant keeps me frustrated and pissed off on a daily. I loathe going there. My last job while stressful was one that made me proud because I felt I had a good crew that I put before the work and we usually put out good work with half the manning. This place makes me feel like I'm nothing.",jobs,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1k8mh7n/when_is_the_money_not_worth_it/,1745699545.0
1k8m3i7,I stood up for myself and got a raise and an office.,"I've worked at the same company for near a decade, and I've always been too afraid to put myself out there and ask for anything. Last week after the company reported some record high numbers for another month I went to my boss and asked for a raise. I was polite but up front. I explained that things were tight, and I said that I really needed another $500 a month to make things work. I wasn't pushy, and I didn't threaten leaving or anything. I just spoke frankly and honestly. All she said was that she'd discuss it with the execs and get back to me. But the next day I was delighted when I was called into her office, thanked me for my years of working there, said I was an exemplary employee, and gave me about $700 a month raise (she said so that after taxes I'd still be at the $500 I needed at least) and an office.

So I guess my advice here is, if you think you deserve a raise then ask for one. I think if you're honest and polite then you shouldn't have anything to worry about. Though of course, I don't know you and maybe the company you work for is awful and your boss is a dick, so this wont apply to everyone. But some people may just not realize that they can just...ask for a raise. You don't HAVE to wait for some yearly review or something.

1k8l9lc,Where to go with Accounts Receivable experience?,"Hey all. I’m a 25 year-old in an LCOL city with a Supply Chain and Operations Management degree. Despite this, I’m on my second AR job since graduating in 2022. Neither job was a pure collections grind like you’d imagine; in fact in my current role I do almost zero actual cash collections, more contract administrating, invoicing and financial reporting. Yet, the titles are still AR. I currently earn $64,000 and enjoy my job (my employer is excellent), which is I understand academically is a good salary and situation for someone my age but of course I don’t feel is enough.

I’ve gone through the stages of degree regret, mulling going back to school (I considered getting a masters in accounting/CPA but discovered I can’t w/o an accounting bachelors), and applying for a hundred supply chain jobs because truly I would like to work in my degree field. However, every day my actual work experience grows and becomes more valuable. “AR” just feels a little… dead endish. So, what’s the best path forward or, failing that, what job duties could I emphasize on a resume to transition into finance, supply chain or something else? Thanks.

1k8kun0,Resume Length,"I'm using several tools to draft my resume, but I don't rely heavily on AI itself, simply because I don't want to lose the authenticity of what I am trying to convey. Tools just enhances some of the verbiage for the bullet points I am trying to convey on my Resume. With that said, I have two questions:

I am applying for leadership roles, and my resume right now is four pages long.

Can anyone help me understand the following:

1. Is it acceptable to have four-page resume?

2. I have a section dedicated to ""skills"", which I look at it as more than just key words. Is it better to remove this section completely or keep it?

I am open to hearing various opinions whether you agree to 4-page resume or not. But please give some context so that it's easier to understand. I am looking for best approach because I haven't had any interviews yet. So it feels weird.

1k8jiwo,Should I tell them the truth,"In December I was fired from my previous job after getting into a text argument with my boss who falsely accused me of stealing and I accused him of trying to replace me. Nothing to do with my performance or ability to do my job. I was fired without cause as said on the termination letter.

Last week I was interviewed by a different company which is large and well known in the industry. The interviewer who is the vice president recognized the my former employer and said he knows my former boss (the industry is very small and tight-knit). I lied to him about why I left and he quickly assumed it was a shortage of work because most companies in our industry are having a very tough time and there's many layoffs. I didn't actually expect to get response thinking he may end up calling my previous boss about me. 

However on Wednesday I was sent an offer. I was excited at first and kind of confused whether he may of or may not have called my previous boss. I quickly got it reviewed by an employment lawyer and she hinted that it's conditional upon a background check and a few things such as the RRSP matching(401k) starts after 12 months but should be after 3 months of work and the termination clause is the bare minimum and the date of the offers expiration is dated ""March 25th"" I'm not really worried about that except the background check. 

Then yesterday I was called by the company's vp  who interviewed and claimed he knows my boss. He seemed very serious on wanting to hire me and said that he likes my energy and seriousness about the job and really believes I could be a great asset. I do want the job but I'm worried of if they get in contact with my former employer who could make me sound really bad. I've asked him if he had already spoken with my former employer he said he hasn't because he doesn't have a reason to but said he doesn't mind if I want him to. So I said it's up to him. 

I have to come back with a signed offer by April 30. What should I do. A part of me thinks I should call the VP back and come clean in case he could oneday get in contact with my former boss while I begin working. Another part of me thinks I should just keep hiding it, sign the offer and start working and do a good job hoping that they'll recognize my skills and talent. I'm conflicted and don't know where to go. I want the job but I'm afraid of losing it and burning a bridge with this new company too.",jobs,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1k8jiwo/should_i_tell_them_the_truth/,1745691628.0

I decided to pursue a passion career in wildlife biology and went back to school, which is kind of crazy at my age. The thing is.. I am not seeing the biologist field to have lot of openings and seems very competitive. If I was younger.. i wouldnt mind, but I realised that I need a full time and stable job as soon as I graduate (in about 3 years). And financially, I am already struggling. Nobody wants to hire students anymore. So I am looking for my plan B and need help. 
I am looking for a career that have good employment (""easy"" to find job offers) and that is stable/guaranteed schedule. BUT I need something that is .. stimulating/not fixing a computer screen for 8hrs. I get super depressed when my days are boring. I used to count hours left in my work days .. it gets you to a dark place. I do not mind working with computers, but you know, something you also move around, get distraction etc. I need to be busy to be mentally healthy. I would aim for 1 to 3 years max of studies also. 

Sorry it is a bit hard to explain, i am also waiting for an orientation specialist appoitment. But sometimes 1 comment can be the one to save my stuck life.

So it was really an accident and kind of a stupid one. It looks suspicious on the video. Someone might think I did it on purpose.

My response is if you make me pay for the damage you have to criminally charge me for willfully destruction of company property. That would be a stretch even for them.
