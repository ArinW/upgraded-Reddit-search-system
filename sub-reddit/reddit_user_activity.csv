Unfortunately, we are all aware that the devs are no longer communicating at the rate or level they used to, and u/JL_Nightmare has confirmed they are all under NDAs (with no explanation as to why they are in place, could be IP). I've asked on his streams several times, but the comments usually go unanswered.

(long post),"A few months back, I made a post asking you all how you felt about the current state of the game; the responses were an interesting mix, although the answers were not particularly surprising. I wanted to revisit that and kind of tweak something (albeit I've no doubt this is going to seem like complaining). I've been a supporter of this game for years, and was enjoying the clunkiness of early access and the updates that came with the development cycle.

I personally don't feel like Session released in an actually viable 1.0 state, the game is most certainly still in a beta stage at best, in my opinion. With horrible ghosting coming from the skater/board that cannot be fixed, updated (yet still unpolished) physics, lackluster animations, no multiplayer, no throw-down animation, I feel like I could rant about this stuff for quite some time. Everyone gangs up on the people who complain, but it feels completely understandable to load this game up after seven months and just be fucking bored.
