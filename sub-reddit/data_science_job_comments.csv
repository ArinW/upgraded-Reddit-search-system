Anyone working as a data scientist/ data analyst/ data engineer? Is getting a job in this field tough as a fresher?,https://www.reddit.com/r/DataScienceJobs/comments/1jhtezu/anyone_working_as_a_data_scientist_data_analyst/,Temporary-Donkey-237,Considering Your situation it would get anywhere around 5 months min to 8 or 7 months max to learn data analyst and make projects. This much knowledge would be enough for you to get an entry level job anywhere around 6 -10 lpa . Remember there's always a time when everyone one starts something for other so it is not late for you .

I’ve got a couple of years of experience working with Python, SQL, ML models, and visualization tools like Tableau & Power BI. Worked across different domains (retail, healthcare, finance), done some cloud stuff (AWS, GCP), and love solving data problems.
If you know of any openings or have tips on where to look, hit me up! Appreciate any leads or referrals. Thanks!"
Jobs in Entry level Data Science ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoJobs/comments/1f2qydf/jobs_in_entry_level_data_science/,nboro94,"Any sort of data science stuff is extremely oversaturated right now, especially in Toronto. Many companies have realized they don't actually need 100s of data scientists working on ML stuff and what they actually need is data engineers who can work on the infrastructure and core reporting for the company.
There is also a big shift towards only hiring people with very senior level skills. A true ""entry level"" job would be very difficult to find in the industry.
Honestly when the industry is as screwed up like this as it is, it really only matters if you know the hiring manager or not and already have your foot in the door. If you really want to work in the industry I would pivot more towards a data analyst position and then make a lateral to ML stuff in the future which would be much easier."

I know it's not that simple, and I'm not in the industry, but I do know that unemployment in NH has been rock bottom for years and businesses are constantly trying to hire for all kinds of roles. I'd be willing to bet you'd have a harder time finding an apartment/house than a job.
The state put out a workforce assessment report identifying the roles with the largest anticipated employment gaps over the next 10 years that may help you or others gauge possible career paths: https://www.nheconomy.com/getmedia/90db0638-52a5-4e4b-ba51-fd06719d30df/Final-Workforce-Assessment-State-of-New-Hampshire-v2.pdf
And, at the end of the day, a significant number of residents live in NH but work for employers in other states"

Living in Seacoast NH can provide a good balance between having in person access to the teams and business/tech partners while also living where you want (assuming NH is a better fit than Boston suburbs).
Source: lead a DS org for a company based in Boston. Work from an office in Portsmouth when I'm not working from home. As another poster mentioned, data scientists are in high demand across many industries, so many companies will hire fully remote. But if having some regular in office time is desirable NH is definitely an option, at least along the southern border."
